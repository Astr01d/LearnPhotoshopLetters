1. Create a new file at any resolution, preferably as big as possible, in this case I am using one with a grey background with the dimension of 1920x1080.
2. Create a new layer folder, let's call this 'Nintendo'.
3. Click on T to select your **Type Tool**.
4. Make the letter **corps 48** with the colour of the letters in their entrity black.
5. We will select the **Acumin Variable Concept** with a **Black Italic** corps.
6. Right click on Nintendo and select **Blending options**.
7. Check **Bevel and Emboss**. **The Options folder inside this repository** should give you images of the settings.
8. Below it, you should see **Contour** make sure to check that one as well and make sure to check the settings.
9. The **Colour Overlay** should be personal preference based on how you make it. 
  *In my case, I prefer Red letters and a white background for the entire thing. Green and Yellow are good examples of complimentary combinations.
  most of the time in this tutorial, it will help if the background is lighter.*
10. The **Drop Shadow** settings are also in the Options folder inside this repository.
  *The drop shadow should be darker than the Colour Overlay.*
11. Now select the **rounded rectangle tool** and make sure that the **radius of it is 130 pixels**
12. The **stroke** should be almost but not exactly as light as the **fill*.
13. Now make a **rectangle over the letters** and make sure that it is a bit bigger than the letters.
14. Make sure that the layer now is **below the letters*.
15. Go to the **blending options** and check the **Stroke** option and make sure that the settings are the same as the image inside the options folder inside the repository.
16. Now make sure that the **Drop shadow** is the checked as well with the same options as the image inside the options folder inside the repository.
